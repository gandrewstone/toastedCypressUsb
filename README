ToastedCypressUsb

This project provides a USB interface in an extremely small and cheap PCB footprint.
It is based on the Cypress CY7C64316 which can be purchased for less then $3 in 
small quantities.  Other external components are minimal; 2 resistors, 1 capacitor,
and the USB connector.  No crystal is necessary, since the chip can recover clocking
from the USB port itself!

You will need to purchase a Cypress firmware uploader (PSoC Miniprog) which 
costs around $20-$30.  

The project provides source code in the form of a Cypress PSoC Designer project.
PSoC Designer is free, but sorry its Windows only.

And Eagle designs are supplied.  One design is for a stand-alone USB programmer
that can plug into the Arduino's ICSP port (thumbUpdater).  I've also added a
few LEDs and the footprint for an IR receiver so you can play with USB to IR as
well.

The other design demonstrates integration into a circuit board (lightuino5).
More information about the Lightuino5 circuit board is located at
